# Scenario2
The second scenario for validating the CB framework.
The benchmark accompying this scenario can be found [here](https://github.com/DawidNiezgodka/tinyFaaS-bench).

## Caveat
This is a preview-only repository.
To conduct the test, it is necessary to set the appropriate secrets, have a GCP project,
modify certain variables, the values of which have been removed for security reasons, and so on.

The details of the setup can be found in the [CB framework repository](https://github.com/DawidNiezgodka/CB-Framework)
